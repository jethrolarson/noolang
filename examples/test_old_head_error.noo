# Test to reproduce the original constraint error

# First, let me temporarily restore the old head function type to see the error
# This won't work with current safe head, but let's test compose with another constrained function

# Test with a function that would have constraints
composed = compose length id;
result = composed 5;  # This should fail - length expects a collection, not Int
