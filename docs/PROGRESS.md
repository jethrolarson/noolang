# Noolang Progress Tracker

## Notes from dev

- Generally speaking, if the next steps are obvious and not dangerous, just do it.

## 🧭 Quick Orientation Guide (For Future Sessions)

### **Project Overview**

Noolang is a **whitespace-significant, LLM-friendly programming language** with explicit effects and strong type inference. It's written in TypeScript with a functional, combinator-based architecture.

### **Key Architecture Decisions**

- **Parser Combinators**: Custom implementation in `src/parser/combinators.ts` for readability
- **Closure-based Evaluation**: Functions capture environments properly for recursion
- **Type Inference**: Hindley-Milner style with unification foundation
- **Immutable by Default**: Mutation requires explicit `mut`/`mut!` syntax
- **Curried Functions**: All functions are curried (Haskell-style)

### **Language Syntax Patterns**

- **Functions**: `fn param => body` (curried)
- **Definitions**: `name = expr` or `name = expr : type`
- **Sequences**: `expr1; expr2` (returns rightmost value)
- **Data Structures**: All use commas `[1,2,3]`, `{@a 1, @b 2}`, `{1,2,3}`
- **Type Annotations**: `name = expr : type` or `(expr : type)`

### **Common Development Patterns**

1. **Testing**: `npm test` runs 316 tests
2. **Performance**: `npm run benchmark` for performance testing
3. **REPL**: `npm run dev` for interactive development
4. **CLI Debugging**: See README.md for comprehensive CLI debugging tools

### **Current State**

## 🔄 FFI System Design (In Planning)

### **Design Philosophy**

Rather than implementing hundreds of built-in functions, Noolang will use a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) system that delegates to platform-specific adapters.

### **Syntax Design**

```noolang
# FFI calls use platform adapters
readFileSync = ffi "node" "fs.readFileSync"  # Node.js adapter interprets the path
malloc = ffi "c" "stdlib.malloc"              # C adapter interprets the path
fetch = ffi "browser" "window.fetch"          # Browser adapter interprets the path
```

### **Type System Integration**

- **Unknown Type**: FFI calls return `Unknown` type by default
- **Type Refinement**: Pattern matching to narrow `Unknown` to concrete types
- **forget Operation**: Convert any type to `Unknown` for dynamic behavior

```noolang
# FFI returns Unknown
readFile = ffi "node" "fs.readFileSync";

# Pattern matching to refine types
content = match (readFile "file.txt") with (
  String s => s;
  Error e => "failed to read";
  _ => "unexpected type"
);

# forget operation for dynamic behavior
myBool = True;
dynamic = forget myBool;  # dynamic: Unknown
```

### **Dependency Chain Analysis**

The FFI system revealed a dependency chain that requires foundational features:

1. **FFI** → needs `Unknown` type for untyped foreign values
2. **Unknown** → needs type refinement through pattern matching
3. **Accessor chaining on Unknown** → needs optional accessors (`@field?`)
4. **Optional accessors** → need `|?` operator for Option chaining
5. **`|?` operator** → needs monadic bind for proper implementation
6. **Monadic bind** → needs trait/typeclass system for polymorphism

### **Current Decision**

**Pausing FFI implementation** to prioritize **trait/typeclass system** as the foundational feature that enables clean implementation of all dependent features.

# Things the human is tracking
- Need to focus on cleanup and simplification of the codebase.
- Find all TODOs
- Type and parser errors should show the source code line and the line above and below
- Imports aren't being inferred correctly
- What if we have a way for the llm to ask what the type at a particular point in the program is? maybe with a `^` character? Similar to how users can hover over code with the mouse. or maybe just supporting LSP will do that?
- Need module paths. Having to load everything via relative paths is troublesome
- we're using both camelCase and snake. Everything should be snake.
- print should be : a -> a given a is Show (maybe log too, or can we just leave that with dumb encoding inferred in host language?)
- <https://llmstxt.org> may be a model for how to document the language. e.g. https://bun.sh/llms.txt
- Maybe not, I'm not sure ~partial match for tuples should be okay: `match {1, False} with ({a} => a)` should be valid~
- Add cli flag for outputing the type-ast
- repl comments shouldn't be typed 
  ```
    noolang> # shouldn't output anything
    ➡ []     : unknown
  ```
