# Trait System Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of Noolang's trait system. The trait system provides function overloading through type-based dispatch, allowing code like `map (fn x => x + 1) [1,2,3]` to work automatically.

## CURRENT STATUS - DECEMBER 2024

**🎉 TRAIT SYSTEM COMPLETE AND PRODUCTION READY! 🎉**

### ✅ ALL CORE PHASES COMPLETE

The trait system is **fully implemented and working perfectly**:

- ✅ **Core Goal Achieved**: `map (fn x => x + 1) [1,2,3]` works flawlessly
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Core infrastructure with `TraitRegistry` and trait system types
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Nominal traits implemented - type-directed dispatch working

## Technical Architecture

### Trait Definition Storage
```typescript
type TraitDefinition = {
	name: string;
	typeParam: string;
	functions: Map<string, Type>;
};
```

### Implementation Storage  
```typescript
type TraitImplementation = {
	typeName: string;
	functions: Map<string, Expression>;
	givenConstraints?: ConstraintExpr;
};
```

### Registry Design
```typescript
type TraitRegistry = {
	definitions: Map<string, TraitDefinition>;
	implementations: Map<string, Map<string, TraitImplementation>>;
	functionTraits: Map<string, string[]>; // Function name conflict tracking
};
```

### Resolution Algorithm
1. **Function Lookup**: Check if function name is defined in any trait
2. **Type Identification**: Extract type name from first argument  
3. **Implementation Search**: Find trait implementations for that type
4. **Ambiguity Detection**: Error if multiple traits provide same function for same type
5. **Runtime Dispatch**: Return implementation expression for evaluation

## Safety Mechanisms

### 1. Signature Validation ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```typescript
// Function implementations must match trait signatures
export function addTraitImplementation(
	registry: TraitRegistry,
	traitName: string, 
	impl: TraitImplementation
): boolean {
	// Validates parameter count and types match expected signature
	// Throws error for mismatched signatures
}
```

### 2. Duplicate Prevention ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```typescript
// Same type cannot implement same trait twice
implement Show Int ( show = toString );
implement Show Int ( show = alternative ); // ❌ ERROR: Duplicate implementation
```

### 3. Ambiguity Detection ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
```typescript
// Same function name from different traits for same type → error
constraint Printable a ( display: a -> String );
constraint Showable a ( display: a -> String );
implement Printable Int ( display = printInt );
implement Showable Int ( display = showInt );
// ❌ ERROR: Ambiguous function call 'display' for Int
```

## Examples

### Working Examples ✅

```noo
# Basic trait definition and implementation
constraint Show a ( show : a -> String );
implement Show Int ( show = toString );
show 42;  # → "42"

# Higher-kinded trait  
constraint Functor f ( map : (a -> b) -> f a -> f b );
implement Functor List ( map = list_map );
map (fn x => x + 1) [1, 2, 3];  # → [2, 3, 4]

# Polymorphic trait function
constraint Monad m ( pure : a -> m a );
implement Monad Option ( pure = Some );
pure 42;  # → Some 42 (with constrained type)

# Conditional implementation (parsed)
implement Show (List a) given a implements Show (
  show = fn list => "[" + (joinStrings ", " (map show list)) + "]"
);
```

## Current Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Conditional Implementation Validation**: `given` constraints are parsed but not fully validated at implementation time
2. **Complex Error Messages**: Could provide more context about constraint origins
3. **Performance**: No optimization for large numbers of implementations (not currently needed)

### Not Planned
- **Overlapping Instances**: Deliberately not supported for coherence
- **Higher-Ranked Types**: Beyond current scope
- **Associated Types**: Advanced feature not currently needed

## Integration Status

### ✅ Working Integrations
- **Parser**: Full syntax support for constraints and implementations
- **Type Inference**: Seamless integration with Hindley-Milner type system  
- **Evaluator**: Runtime trait function resolution
- **REPL**: Interactive trait usage
- **Standard Library**: Built-in traits (Show, Functor, Monad, Eq, Applicative)
- **ADT System**: Works with pattern matching and algebraic data types
- **Effect System**: Trait functions properly track effects
- **Pipeline Operators**: `|>`, `|`, `$` work with trait functions

## Next Steps (Maintenance Phase)

### 🧹 Test Consolidation (High Priority)
**Issue**: 10+ scattered trait test files with overlapping functionality
**Solution**: Consolidate into 3-4 well-organized test suites
- `trait-system-core.test.ts` - Registry, resolution, basic functionality
- `trait-system-integration.test.ts` - Parser, type inference, evaluation  
- `trait-system-safety.test.ts` - Error handling, conflicts, edge cases
- `trait-system-stdlib.test.ts` - Standard library trait testing

### 🔍 Edge Case Coverage (Medium Priority)
- Conditional implementation validation at runtime
- Complex nested type constructor scenarios
- Performance testing with many implementations

### 📝 Documentation Updates (Low Priority)  
- Update README to reflect completion status
- Document trait best practices
- Performance benchmarking guidelines

## Phase 4: Record Structural Constraints with `has` (Planned)

### Overview
Extend the constraint system with structural constraints using the `has` keyword for duck-typed records. This maintains Noolang's duck typing philosophy while adding compile-time structural verification. Tuple structural constraints are planned for a future phase once tuple pattern matching is implemented.

### Core Design Principles
- **Duck Typing Preserved**: `has` constraints mean "at least this structure" (extra fields allowed)
- **Concrete Types for Exactness**: Use concrete record types when you need exactly that structure
- **Natural Syntax**: Use record literal syntax on RHS of `has`
- **Safe Accessor Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing `@field` accessor system

### Syntax Design

#### Record Structural Constraints
```noo
# Basic record constraints
given a has {@name String, @age Int}

# Nested record constraints  
given a has {@person {@name String}, @address {@street String, @city String}}

# Mixed with other constraints
given a has {@items List b} and Show b

# Wildcard for "don't care about this field's type"
given a has {@name String, @metadata _}
```

#### Future: Tuple Structural Constraints (When Pattern Matching Ready)
```noo
# These will be supported once tuple pattern matching is implemented
# given a has {Int, String}           # At least Int, String
# given a has {_, Int, String}        # Second element Int, third String
```

### Use Cases

#### Record Interface Functions
```noo
# Functions that work with any record having required fields
greet = fn person => concat "Hello " (@name person)
  : a -> String given a has {@name String}

# Works with any record containing @name
greet {@name "Alice", @age 30}                    # ✅ Works
greet {@name "Bob", @city "NYC", @id 123}         # ✅ Works (extra fields ignored)
```

#### Domain Modeling Functions  
```noo
# User profile functions that work with any record having required fields
getUserDisplayName = fn user =>
  concat (@firstName user) (concat " " (@lastName user))
  : a -> String given a has {@firstName String, @lastName String}

# Address formatting that requires nested structure
formatAddress = fn obj =>
  addr = @address obj;
  concat (@street addr) (concat ", " (@city addr))
  : a -> String given a has {@address {@street String, @city String}}

# Function composition with structural constraints
getFullUserInfo = fn user =>
  name = getUserDisplayName user;
  address = formatAddress user;
  concat name (concat " lives at " address)
  : a -> String given 
    a has {@firstName String, @lastName String} and
    a has {@address {@street String, @city String}}

# Works with any record having the required nested structure
user1 = {@firstName "Alice", @lastName "Smith", @address {@street "123 Main St", @city "Boston"}, @age 30};
user2 = {@firstName "Bob", @lastName "Jones", @address {@street "456 Oak Ave", @city "Portland"}, @id 12345, @department "Engineering"};

getFullUserInfo user1  # ✅ "Alice Smith lives at 123 Main St, Boston"
getFullUserInfo user2  # ✅ "Bob Jones lives at 456 Oak Ave, Portland" (extra fields ignored)
```

### Integration with Existing System

#### Constraint Composition
```noo
# Combine has constraints with trait constraints
processItems = fn container => 
  map show (@items container)
  : a -> List String given a has {@items List b} and Show b

# Multiple has constraints
validatePerson = fn data =>
  concat (concat (@name (@person data)) " at ") (@street (@address data))
  : a -> String given 
    a has {@person {@name String}} and 
    a has {@address {@street String}}
```

#### Type Inference Integration
```noo
# Type inference should derive has constraints from usage
getCoordinateSum = fn point => 
  (tupleGet 0 point) + (tupleGet 1 point)
# Should infer: a -> Int given a has {Int, Int}

# Using record accessors should infer record constraints
getPersonInfo = fn p => 
  concat (@name p) (concat " is " (toString (@age p)))
# Should infer: a -> String given a has {@name String, @age Int}
```

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 4.1: Parser Extensions
- Extend constraint parsing to support `has` keyword
- Add support for record/tuple literal syntax in constraint expressions
- Parse wildcard `_` in constraint contexts

#### Phase 4.2: Type System Integration  
- Extend `ConstraintExpr` AST to include structural constraints
- Implement constraint validation logic for `has` constraints
- Integrate with existing constraint resolution during unification

#### Phase 4.3: Error Messages and Validation
- Design helpful error messages for structural constraint violations
- Implement constraint checking during type checking
- Add constraint propagation through function composition

#### Phase 4.4: Standard Library Integration
- Add generic tuple accessor functions (`first`, `second`, `third`)
- Provide utility functions for common structural patterns
- Update existing functions to use structural constraints where appropriate

### Future Considerations
- **Performance**: Structural constraint checking should be efficient for large record types
- **Error Messages**: Design clear, helpful messages for constraint violations (implementation detail)
- **Type Derivation**: Automatic derivation of `has` constraints from accessor usage patterns
- **Advanced Patterns**: Support for more complex structural requirements if needed

## Phase 5: Tuple Structural Constraints (Future)

### Prerequisites
- **Tuple Pattern Matching**: Must be implemented first to enable safe tuple destructuring
- **Pattern Syntax**: `{x, y, z}` tuple patterns with variable binding and wildcards

### Design Plan

#### Tuple Structural Constraints
```noo
# Basic tuple constraints (once pattern matching exists)
given a has {Int, String}           # At least Int, String (extra elements OK)
given a has {_, Int, String}        # Second element Int, third String  
given a has {_, _, Float}           # Third element must be Float

# Nested tuple constraints
given a has {{Int, Int}, String}    # First element is coordinate pair
```

#### Tuple Accessor Functions with Pattern Matching
```noo
# Safe tuple accessors using pattern matching
first = fn t => match t with ({x, ...} => x)
  : a -> b given a has {b}

second = fn t => match t with ({_, x, ...} => x)  
  : a -> b given a has {_, b}

# Coordinate operations with pattern matching
distance2D = fn p1 p2 => 
  match {p1, p2} with ({{x1, y1, ...}, {x2, y2, ...}} => 
    abs (x2 - x1) + abs (y1 - y2))
  : a -> a -> Int given a has {Int, Int}

# Pattern matching provides safety - no runtime crashes
getSecond = fn coords => match coords with 
  ({_, x, ...} => Some x; _ => None)
  : a -> Option b given a has {_, b}
```

#### Integration with Record Constraints
```noo
# Mixed record and tuple constraints
processData = fn obj =>
  match (@coordinates obj) with 
    ({x, y, ...} => x + y)
  : a -> Int given a has {@coordinates {Int, Int}}

# Complex nested structures
validateUser = fn user =>
  match (@location (@profile user)) with
    ({lat, lng, ...} => lat > 0 && lng > 0)
  : a -> Bool given a has {@profile {@location {Int, Int}}}
```

#### Wildcard Syntax for Tuples
- **`_`** - "Any type, don't care" (consistent with pattern matching)
- **Duck typing default**: Extra elements beyond constraint automatically allowed
- **`{_, Int}`** - "At least 2 elements, second must be Int" (extra elements OK)

#### Implementation Requirements
1. **Pattern Parser**: Extend parser to handle `{x, y, z}` tuple patterns
2. **Pattern Matcher**: Extend evaluator to match tuple patterns against tuple values
3. **Type Checker**: Validate tuple patterns against tuple types
4. **Constraint Integration**: Add tuple structure validation to constraint system

### Benefits of Waiting
- **Safety First**: Pattern matching provides compile-time guarantees about tuple structure
- **Consistent Syntax**: Tuple constraints will use same patterns as tuple destructuring
- **No Unsafe Operations**: Avoids need for `tupleGet` and other runtime-unsafe operations
- **Complete Feature**: Tuple constraints will be fully integrated with pattern matching from day one

### 🎯 Potential Enhancements (Future)
Only implement if specifically requested:
- **Associated Types**: Types associated with trait instances
- **Constraint Synonyms**: Type aliases for common constraint patterns  
- **Advanced Error Messages**: Constraint origin tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching for large trait hierarchies
