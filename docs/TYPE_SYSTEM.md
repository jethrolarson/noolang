## 🧠 Noolang Type System and Effect Model (for Cursor)

Noolang is a principled, expression-based language designed for LLM-assisted and human-readable programming. The type system is lightweight but expressive, favoring inference and explicit effects over full dependent types.

---

### 🔤 Type System Overview

#### **Type Syntax**

* **Unified type annotations**: `expr : type` syntax works everywhere
* **Definition context**: `name = expr : type` (no parentheses needed)
* **Expression context**: `(expr : type)` (parentheses for precedence/clarity)
* Function types: `(Arg1 Arg2) -> Return` (right-associative)
* Type annotations are optional but encouraged; required for all effectful expressions
* Type aliases and nominal types are allowed (planned)

#### **Type Annotation Scoping Rules**

* **Sequences**: Type annotations apply to the expression immediately preceding them
  ```noolang
  a = 1; b = 2; c = 3 : Number  # Only c = 3 is Number
  ```
* **Parentheses**: Group expressions to apply type to the whole group
  ```noolang
  a = (1; 2; 3) : Number  # Only the final expression '3' is Number
  ```
* **Nested annotations**: Can annotate subexpressions within sequences
  ```noolang
  (
    1 : Number;
    False : Boolean;
    "foo" : String
  ) : String  # Each subexpression checked, final type is String
  ```

#### **Primitive Types**

* `Number`, `Bool`, `String`
* Type constructors: `List T`, `Tuple T1 T2`, `Record { name: String age: Number }` (planned)
* `unit` represents the unit type (empty value)

#### **Data Structure Type Annotations**

* **Tuples**: Require type for each slot
  ```noolang
  pair = {1, 2} : {Number, Number}  # ✅ Correct
  triple = {1, 2, 3} : Number       # ❌ Error - tuples need types for each slot
  ```
* **Records**: Require type for each field
  ```noolang
  person = {@name "Alice", @age 30} : {@name String, @age Number}
  ```
* **Lists**: Type applies to element type
  ```noolang
  numbers = [1, 2, 3] : [Number]
  ```

#### **Polymorphism**

* Lowercase type names (`a`, `b`) are considered generic type variables
* **✅ Type Variable Unification**: Type variables are properly unified to concrete types

  ```noolang
  identity = fn x => x : a -> a  # Polymorphic type variables work correctly
  add = fn x y => x + y         # Shows (Int) -> (Int) -> Int, not t1 -> t2 -> t3
  ```

---

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTED: Type Constraints and Constrained Polymorphism**

Noolang now supports **type constraints** for more expressive and safe generic programming.

#### **Current Implementation Status**

* **✅ Constraint System**: Fully implemented with Hindley-Milner style inference
* **✅ Constraint Propagation**: Constraints are properly propagated through function composition
* **✅ Built-in Constraints**: `Collection`, `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Show`, `List`, `Record`, `Function`
* **✅ Constraint Validation**: Type checker enforces constraints during unification
* **✅ Error Reporting**: Clear error messages when constraints are violated

#### **Current Constraint Syntax**

Constraints are currently embedded in function types and propagated automatically:

```noolang
# Built-in functions with constraints
head : List a -> a given a is Collection
tail : List a -> List a given a is Collection
length : List a -> Number given a is Collection

# Constraint propagation works through composition
compose = fn f g => fn x => f (g x)
safeHead = compose head  # Constraint 'a is Collection' is preserved
```

#### **Constraint System Features**

* **Automatic Propagation**: Constraints flow through function composition
* **Built-in Constraints**: Predefined constraints for common type classes
* **Constraint Checking**: Violations are caught during type inference
* **Error Messages**: Clear feedback when constraints are not satisfied

#### **Example: Constraint Violation**

```noolang
# This will throw a type error because Int does not satisfy Collection constraint
compose = fn f g => fn x => f (g x)
safeHead = compose head
listId = fn x => x
result = safeHead listId [1, 2, 3]  # ❌ Error: Int does not satisfy Collection constraint
```

---

### 🚧 **PLANNED: Constraint Annotations with "and"/"or" Syntax**

Noolang will support **explicit constraint annotations** using postfix syntax with logical operators.

#### **Proposed Syntax**

* **Postfix constraints**: `: type given constraint1 and constraint2`
* **Logical operators**: `and` for conjunction, `or` for disjunction
* **Clear semantics**: Explicit logical relationships between constraints

#### **Examples**

```noolang
# Single constraint
id : a -> a given a is Collection

# Multiple constraints with "and"
map : (a -> b, List a) -> List b given a is Show and b is Eq

# Complex constraint logic with "or"
flexible : a -> b given 
  (a is Collection and b is Show) or 
  (a is String and b is Eq)

# Nested constraints
nested : a -> b given 
  a is Collection and 
  (b is Show or b is Eq)
```

#### **Design Rationale**

* **Postfix for consistency**: Keeps main type signature uncluttered
* **"and"/"or" for clarity**: Explicit logical operators, very LLM-friendly
* **Extensible**: Easy to add complex constraint logic and union types
* **Familiar**: Similar to Haskell's `=>` and Rust's `where` clauses

#### **Implementation Plan**

1. **Parser**: Add constraint annotation parsing to type expressions
2. **AST**: Extend type nodes to include explicit constraint annotations
3. **Type System**: Integrate with existing constraint propagation system
4. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages for constraint violations
5. **REPL Support**: Show constraints in type inference output

---

#### **Optional + Result Types**

* `Option a` represents optional values (planned)
* `Result a e` represents success (`Ok a`) or failure (`Err e`) (planned)
* `unit` is used to represent absence or unit values

---

### ⚡ Effect System

Noolang makes **side effects explicit** in types. All functions that perform I/O, mutation, or other impure operations must declare those effects.

#### **🎯 Effect System Refactoring Plan**

**Current Problem**: Effects are embedded within function types, creating architectural limitations.

**Target Architecture**: Expressions should have **`(Type, Effects)` pairs** instead of types with embedded effects.

```typescript
// Current: Effects embedded in types  
type TypeWithEffects = FunctionType & { effects: Effect[] }

// Target: Separate type and effects
type ExpressionResult = {
  type: Type,
  effects: Effects  
}
```

#### **Effect Type Syntax**

* Effects follow the return type using postfix annotation: `: Type !effect1 !effect2`
* **Design Philosophy**: Using effects should be "a little annoying" to encourage pure code
* **Explicit Only**: No effect inference - all effects must be declared manually

```noolang
# Pure expressions - no effects
add = fn x y => x + y : (Int) -> (Int) -> Int

# Effectful expressions - explicit effect annotations  
readFile = fn path => ... : String !read
logLine = fn msg => log msg : Unit !log
getUserInput = fn prompt => ... : String !read !log
```

#### **Effect Composition Rules**

* **Union Composition**: `!write !read + !log !read = !write !read !log`
* **Explicit Effects**: Keep all effects visible rather than unifying to most permissive
* **Effect Propagation**: Effects must propagate through function composition

```noolang
# Effect composition examples
fileLogger = fn msg => (
  content = readFile "log.txt" : String !read;
  logLine (content + msg) : {} !log  
) : Unit !read !log  # Both effects required

# Function composition preserves effects
safeFileLog = compose fileLogger  # Still requires !read !log
```

#### **Implementation Plan**

**✅ Phase 1: Enable Parser (COMPLETE)**
1. ✅ Fixed `!effect` parsing syntax in parser
2. ✅ Updated AST types to include effect annotations  
3. ✅ Basic parsing working without breaking existing code
4. ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 10/10 tests passing
5. ✅ Refactored to use `Set<Effect>` for automatic deduplication
6. ✅ Proper error handling for invalid effects and syntax

**✅ Phase 2: Type System Integration (COMPLETE)**
7. ✅ Modified `TypeResult` in `src/typer/types.ts` to include effects
8. ✅ Updated `typeExpression` to return `(Type, Effects)` pairs
9. ✅ Implemented effect union composition logic

**✅ Phase 3: Effect Validation (COMPLETE)**  
10. ✅ Check that functions with effects are properly annotated
11. ✅ Propagate effects through function composition
12. ✅ Add effect mismatch error reporting

#### **Current Effect Implementation**

* **✅ Phase 1 Complete**: Effect parsing syntax fully implemented and working
* **✅ Phase 2 Complete**: Effects separated into (Type, Effects) pairs throughout type system
* **✅ Phase 3 Complete**: Effect validation and propagation through all language constructs
* **✅ Parser Support**: Functions can be typed with effects using `!effect` syntax
* **✅ Set-based Storage**: Effects stored as `Set<Effect>` for automatic deduplication
* **✅ Comprehensive Testing**: Phase 2 (31/31), Phase 3 (32/41) tests passing
* **✅ Built-in Functions**: Complete set of effectful functions (read/write, logging, random, state mutation)
* **✅ Effect Propagation**: Automatic effect collection through function composition and data structures

#### **Rules**

* Pure expressions need no effect annotations
* Effects are compositional and must propagate up through the call chain
* The type checker must enforce that callers of effectful functions also declare those effects
* A file is considered effectful if its top-level expression is effectful

#### **Planned Core Effects**

| Effect   | Purpose                                   | Why include it                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!log`   | Logging, tracing, debugging output        | Ubiquitous and benign, but useful to track              |
| `!read`  | External reads (file, network, env)       | Non-deterministic input                                 |
| `!write` | External writes (file, network, env)      | Side effects / state mutation                           |
| `!state` | Mutable internal state (refs, cells, etc) | Tracks impurity without implying I/O                    |
| `!time`  | Access to clocks or timers                | Invisible side effects and determinism risk             |
| `!rand`  | RNG or anything entropy-based             | Non-determinism / fuzzing risk                          |
| `!ffi`   | Calls to native or foreign functions      | Black-box behavior, may implicitly wrap other effects   |
| `!async` | Execution that may suspend or defer       | Time non-locality; may delay evaluation or resume later |

6. **VSCode Integration**: Language Server Protocol (LSP) for intellisense and hover type information

---

### 🎯 Planned: Destructuring Patterns

Noolang will support **destructuring patterns** for tuples and records to enable more ergonomic data extraction and import spreading.

#### **Design Philosophy**

* **Safety First**: Only support destructuring for data structures with fixed, statically-known structure
* **Explicit Patterns**: Clear, predictable syntax that's LLM-friendly
* **No List Destructuring**: Lists have variable length, making destructuring unsafe
* **Immutable Variables**: Destructuring creates new immutable bindings

#### **Tuple Destructuring**

Extract values from tuples by position:

```noolang
# Basic tuple destructuring
{one, two} = {1, True}  # one = 1, two = True

# With type annotations
{first: Number, second: String} = {42, "hello"}  # first = 42, second = "hello"

# Nested destructuring (future)
{outer: {inner, rest}} = {outer: {1, 2}, rest: 3}
```

**Grammar**: `{identifier, identifier, ...} = tuple_expression`

#### **Record Destructuring**

Extract fields from records with flexible naming:

```noolang
# Record destructuring with renaming
{@key localName} = {@key True}  # localName = True

# Record shorthand (field name = variable name)
{@key, @key2} = {@key True, @key2 2}  # key = True, key2 = 2

# Mixed renaming and shorthand
{@name userName, @age} = {@name "Alice", @age 30}  # userName = "Alice", age = 30
```

**Grammar**: 
* `{@identifier identifier} = record_expression` (rename)
* `{@identifier} = record_expression` (shorthand)

#### **Import Spreading**

Use destructuring to extract functions from imported modules:

```noolang
# Import and destructure math functions
{add, multiply} = import "std/math"
result = add 2 3

# Import with renaming
{@add addFn, @multiply mulFn} = import "std/math"
result = addFn 2 3

# Import with shorthand
{@add, @multiply} = import "std/math"
result = add 2 3
```

#### **Safety Guarantees**

* **No Name Collisions**: Attempting to destructure into an existing variable name is an error
* **Complete Patterns**: All fields in a record must be accounted for (no partial destructuring)
* **Type Safety**: Each destructured field gets proper type inference
* **Static Analysis**: All destructuring patterns are validated at parse time

#### **Implementation Requirements**

1. **Parser**: Add destructuring patterns to definition expressions
2. **AST**: `TupleDestructuringExpression`, `RecordDestructuringExpression` node types
3. **Evaluator**: Extract and bind multiple values from destructured data
4. **Type System**: Handle type inference for each destructured field
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for incomplete or invalid patterns

#### **Why No List Destructuring**

List destructuring is intentionally excluded because:

* **Variable Length**: Lists can have any length, making patterns unpredictable
* **Runtime Errors**: Would require complex error handling for length mismatches
* **Type Safety**: Hard to statically guarantee pattern safety
* **Alternative**: Use `head`/`tail` functions or future pattern matching

#### **Future Extensions**

* **Nested Destructuring**: Support destructuring within destructuring patterns
* **Default Values**: Allow default values for optional record fields
* **Pattern Matching**: Integrate with future `match`/`case` expressions
* **Type Annotations**: Support type annotations within destructuring patterns

## 🔄 Import System and Typeclass Design (Current Planning)

### Import System Evolution

Based on ongoing design discussions, we're evaluating how to evolve from the current CommonJS-style import system to better support named imports and typeclass/constraint integration.

#### Current Implementation
```noolang
# Current: import returns a single value (usually a record)
math = import "math.noo"
result = (@add math) 2 3
```

#### Proposed Import Syntax Options

**Option 1: Destructuring-based (Preferred)**
```noolang
# Dependency→Value flow: module path first, then specificity
import "module.noo" {@foo, @bar}  # Named destructuring
import "module.noo" *             # Import everything
import "module.noo" @single_thing # Single import

# Alternative destructuring syntax
{@foo, @bar} = import "module.noo"
```

**Option 2: From-style (Traditional)**
```noolang
import {foo, bar} from "module.noo"
import * from "module.noo"  
import "module.noo" as mod
```

#### Design Principles
- **Lexical Scoping**: Imports apply to current expression scope, not globally
- **Dependency→Value Flow**: Left-to-right reading with increasing specificity
- **Tooling Support**: Module path first enables better autocomplete
- **Consistent Syntax**: Should feel natural within noo's existing patterns

#### Constraint Import Challenge

Key architectural question: How do constraints become available in the type environment?

**The Problem**: If constraints are just regular values, then `{@MyConstraint} = import "module.noo"` should only put a constraint value in scope, not automatically register it with the type checker.

**Possible Solutions**:
1. **Special Import Syntax**: Different syntax for type-level constructs vs values
2. **Explicit Activation**: `use @MyConstraint` after importing 
3. **Magic Destructuring**: Destructuring automatically activates constraints (inconsistent)
4. **Constraints as Non-Values**: Constraints work differently than regular values

### Typeclass Architecture Vision

#### Learning from Other Languages
- **Haskell**: Automatic instance resolution, coherence guarantees
- **Rust**: Explicit trait bounds, orphan rules
- **Swift**: Protocol conformance, extensions
- **Scala**: Implicit parameters, type class encoding

#### Open Design Questions

1. **User-Defined Constraints**: How do users define their own typeclasses?
   ```noolang
   # Possible syntax?
   constraint Numeric a where
     add : a -> a -> a
     multiply : a -> a -> a
   ```

2. **Instance Definition**: How are constraint implementations provided?
   ```noolang
   # Possible syntax?
   instance Numeric Int where
     add = intAdd
     multiply = intMultiply
   ```

3. **Import Integration**: How do constraints and instances flow through modules?
   ```noolang
   # How would this work?
   import "numeric.noo" {Numeric}
   use Numeric  # Activate for type checking?
   ```

4. **Resolution Strategy**: Automatic instance resolution vs explicit passing?

#### Current Constraint System Status
- ✅ **hasField constraints**: Working well for record field access
- ✅ **Constraint propagation**: Automatic through function composition  
- ❌ **User-defined constraints**: Not yet supported
- ❌ **Constraint import/export**: Architecture unclear
- 🧹 **Cleanup complete**: Removed meaningless built-in constraints

#### Next Steps for Typeclass System
1. **Design constraint definition syntax**
2. **Plan instance resolution mechanism** 
3. **Integrate with import system design**
4. **Consider effect system interactions**
5. **Prototype user-defined constraint support**

### 🎯 Planned: VSCode Type Integration

Enable rich editor support through Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration.

#### **Core Features**

* **Hover Type Information**: Show inferred types when hovering over expressions
* **Intellisense/Autocomplete**: Variable names, function signatures, record field suggestions
* **Error Squiggles**: Real-time type error highlighting
* **Go-to-Definition**: Navigate to variable/function definitions

#### **Implementation Strategy**

The existing type system infrastructure provides everything needed:

* **Type Inference**: Hindley-Milner system already computes all type information
* **AST Mapping**: Parser tracks source positions for mapping cursor to AST nodes
* **VSCode Extension**: Foundation already exists with syntax highlighting

#### **LSP Server Architecture**

```typescript
// Core LSP operations using existing type system
onHover(position) => {
  const node = findASTNodeAtPosition(position)
  const typeResult = typeExpression(node, currentState)
  return formatTypeForDisplay(typeResult.type)
}

onCompletion(position) => {
  const context = getCompletionContext(position)
  return getAvailableCompletions(context.environment)
}
```

#### **Development Benefits**

* **Type-aware Development**: See type information while coding
* **Error Prevention**: Catch type errors before running code
* **Enhanced Productivity**: Autocomplete reduces typing and errors
* **Learning Aid**: Understand type inference results interactively
