Absolutely. Here's a concise, targeted write-up you can pass to Cursor to ground it in your type system and effect model for **Noolang**:

## ðŸ§  Noolang Type System and Effect Model (for Cursor)

Noolang is a principled, expression-based language designed for LLM-assisted and human-readable programming. The type system is lightweight but expressive, favoring inference and explicit effects over full dependent types.

---

### ðŸ”¤ Type System Overview

#### **Type Syntax**

* Types appear in postfix position: `expr : Type`
* Function types: `(Arg1 Arg2) -> Return`
* Type annotations are optional but encouraged; required for all effectful expressions
* Type aliases and nominal types are allowed (planned)

#### **Primitive Types**

* `Int`, `Bool`, `String`
* Type constructors: `List T`, `Tuple T1 T2`, `Record { name: String age: Int }`
* `unit` represents the unit type (empty value)

#### **Polymorphism**

* Lowercase type names (`a`, `b`) are considered generic type variables

  ```noolang
  identity = fn x => x : a -> a
  ```

#### **Optional + Result Types**

* `Option a` represents optional values
* `Result a e` represents success (`Ok a`) or failure (`Err e`)
* `unit` is used to represent absence or unit values

---

### âš¡ Effect System

Noolang makes **side effects explicit** in types. All functions that perform I/O, mutation, or other impure operations must declare those effects.

#### **Effect Type Syntax**

* Effects follow the return type using postfix annotation: `: Type !effect1 !effect2`

  ```noolang
  readFile = path => ... : String !io
  ```

#### **Rules**

* Pure expressions need no effect annotations
* Effects are compositional and must propagate up through the call chain
* The type checker must enforce that callers of effectful functions also declare those effects
* A file is considered effectful if its top-level expression is effectful

#### **Planned Core Effects**

* `!io` â€“ input/output
* `!log` â€“ logging or console output
* `!mut` â€“ local mutation
* `!rand` â€“ nondeterminism
* `!err` â€“ error throwing (if introduced; currently `Result` is preferred)

#### **Examples**

```noolang
logLine = fn msg => log msg : unit !log

getUserName = fn () => readFile "/user.txt" : String !io

compute = fn n => n * n : Int
```

---

### ðŸ”§ Type Inference Strategy (Early Phase)

* Local inference only; no global type solving required
* Variables without annotations are inferred if:

  * Used consistently
  * Do not require generalization
* Effects must always be declared manually and are not inferred (by design)
* REPL and dev tools can show inferred types inline for LLM and human inspection

---

### ðŸ§ª Notes for Implementation

* Youâ€™ll need a representation of types in the AST, and a unification-style type checker for local inference
* Effects can be modeled as sets of strings or enums and attached to return types
* Type errors must include information about effect mismatches, missing annotations, and arity issues
