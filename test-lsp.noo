# Test file for LSP functionality
# This should trigger the LSP when opened in VSCode

x = 42;
y = "hello";
z = true;

# Function definition - LSP should provide completion here
add = fn a b => a + b;

# Pattern matching - LSP should understand this
result = match x with (42 => "forty-two";_ => "other");

# Record type - LSP should provide field completion
person = { name = "Alice", age = 30 };

# This should show type errors if LSP is working
invalid = x + y  # Type error: int + string
