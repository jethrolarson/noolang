## 🧠 Noolang Type System and Effect Model (for Cursor)

Noolang is a principled, expression-based language designed for LLM-assisted and human-readable programming. The type system is lightweight but expressive, favoring inference and explicit effects over full dependent types.

---

### 🔤 Type System Overview

#### **Type Syntax**

* **Unified type annotations**: `expr : type` syntax works everywhere
* **Definition context**: `name = expr : type` (no parentheses needed)
* **Expression context**: `(expr : type)` (parentheses for precedence/clarity)
* Function types: `(Arg1 Arg2) -> Return` (right-associative)
* Type annotations are optional but encouraged; required for all effectful expressions
* Type aliases and nominal types are allowed (planned)

#### **Type Annotation Scoping Rules**

* **Sequences**: Type annotations apply to the expression immediately preceding them
  ```noolang
  a = 1; b = 2; c = 3 : Float  # Only c = 3 is Float
  ```
* **Parentheses**: Group expressions to apply type to the whole group
  ```noolang
  a = (1; 2; 3) : Float  # Only the final expression '3' is Float
  ```
* **Nested annotations**: Can annotate subexpressions within sequences
  ```noolang
  (
    1 : Float;
    False : Boolean;
    "foo" : String
  ) : String  # Each subexpression checked, final type is String
  ```

#### **Primitive Types**

* `Float`, `Bool`, `String`
* Type constructors: `List T`, `Tuple T1 T2`, `Record { name: String age: Float }` (planned)
* `unit` represents the unit type (empty value)

#### **Data Structure Type Annotations**

* **Tuples**: Require type for each slot
  ```noolang
  pair = {1, 2} : {Float, Float}  # ✅ Correct
  triple = {1, 2, 3} : {Float}       # ❌ Error - tuples need types for each slot
  ```
* **Records**: Require type for each field
  ```noolang
  person = {@name "Alice", @age 30} : {@name String, @age Float}
  ```
* **Lists**: Type applies to element type
  ```noolang
  numbers = [1, 2, 3] : [Float]
  ```

#### **Polymorphism**

* Lowercase type names (`a`, `b`) are considered generic type variables
* **✅ Type Variable Unification**: Type variables are properly unified to concrete types

  ```noolang
  identity = fn x => x : a -> a  # Polymorphic type variables work correctly
  add = fn x y => x + y         # Shows (Float) -> (Float) -> Float, not t1 -> t2 -> t3
  ```

---

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTED: Type Constraints and Constrained Polymorphism**

Noolang now supports **type constraints** for more expressive and safe generic programming.

#### **Current Implementation Status**

* **✅ Constraint System**: Fully implemented with Hindley-Milner style inference
* **✅ Constraint Propagation**: Constraints are properly propagated through function composition
* **✅ Built-in Constraints**: `Collection`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Show`, `List`, `Record`, `Function`
* **✅ Constraint Validation**: Type checker enforces constraints during unification
* **✅ Error Reporting**: Clear error messages when constraints are violated

### ✅ **IMPLEMENTED: Trait System with Constraint Resolution**

Noolang now features a **complete trait system** that enables constraint-based polymorphism through constraint definitions, implementations, and automatic type-directed dispatch.

#### **Trait System Features**

* **✅ Constraint Definitions**: Full parser and AST support for defining constraints at top level
* **✅ Constraint Implementations**: Complete implementation system with conditional constraints  
* **✅ Type-Directed Dispatch**: Automatic resolution of constraint functions to implementations
* **✅ Multiple Functions**: Support for constraints with multiple function signatures
* **✅ Conditional Constraints**: `given` clauses for dependent implementations
* **✅ Error Handling**: Helpful error messages for missing implementations
* **✅ Parser Integration**: Full lexer and parser support for trait syntax
* **✅ Type System Integration**: Complete integration with type inference and checking
* **✅ Top-Level Support**: Constraint and implement statements work at program top level
* **✅ Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite (14/14 trait system tests passing)

#### **Constraint Definition Syntax**

```noolang
# Simple constraint with one function
constraint Show a ( show : a -> String );

# Constraint with multiple functions
constraint Eq a ( 
  equals : a -> a -> Bool; 
  notEquals : a -> a -> Bool 
);

# Complex constraint with generic functions
constraint Monad m (
  return : a -> m a;
  bind : m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
);
```

#### **Implementation Syntax**

```noolang
# Basic implementation
implement Show Float ( show = intToString );

# Implementation with multiple functions
implement Eq String ( 
  equals = stringEquals;
  notEquals = fn a b => not (stringEquals a b)
);

# Conditional implementation
implement Show (List a) given Show a (
  show = fn list => "[" + (joinStrings ", " (map show list)) + "]"
);
```

#### **Type-Directed Dispatch**

Constraint functions automatically resolve to the correct implementation based on argument types:

```noolang
# These calls automatically resolve to the right implementation
show 42              # Uses Show Float implementation
show "hello"         # Uses Show String implementation  
show [1, 2, 3]       # Uses Show (List a) implementation with Show Float

equals 1 2           # Uses Eq Float implementation
equals "a" "b"       # Uses Eq String implementation
```

#### **Complete Top-Level Example**

```noolang
# Define a constraint at top level
constraint Show a ( show : a -> String );

# Implement the constraint for different types
implement Show Float ( show = toString );
implement Show String ( show = fn s => s );

# Define another constraint
constraint Eq a ( 
  equals : a -> a -> Bool; 
  notEquals : a -> a -> Bool 
);

# Implement for Float
implement Eq Float ( 
  equals = fn a b => a == b;
  notEquals = fn a b => a != b
);

# Use constraint functions - they resolve automatically
result1 = show 42;           # "42"
result2 = show "hello";      # "hello"  
result3 = equals 1 2;        # False
result4 = notEquals 1 2;     # True
```

#### **Current Constraint Syntax**

Constraints are currently embedded in function types and propagated automatically:

```noolang

# TODO make examples (that aren't the same as the built-in ones)
```

#### **Integration with Existing Features**


```noolang
# With higher-order functions
showAll = map show    # Automatically constrains to Show a => List a -> List String

# With pipeline operators
result = [1, 2, 3] |> map show |> joinStrings ", "

# With ADTs and pattern matching
type Option a = Some a | None;
implement Show (Option a) given Show a (
  show = fn opt => match opt (
    Some x => "Some(" + show x + ")";
    None => "None"
  )
);
```

---

### Constraint Annotations with "and" Syntax**

Noolang supports **explicit constraint annotations** using postfix syntax with logical operators.

#### **Proposed Syntax**

* **Postfix constraints**: `: type given constraint1 and constraint2`
* **Logical operators**: `and` for conjunction, `or` for disjunction
* **Clear semantics**: Explicit logical relationships between constraints

#### **Examples**

```noolang
# Single constraint
id : a -> a given a is Collection

# Multiple constraints with "and" (bad example)
map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b given a is Show and b is Eq

# Complex constraint logic with "or"
flexible : a -> b given 
  (a is Collection and b is Show) or 
  (a is String and b is Eq)

# Nested constraints
nested : a -> b given 
  a is Collection and 
  (b is Show or b is Eq)
```

#### **Design Rationale**

* **Postfix for consistency**: Keeps main type signature uncluttered
* **"and"/"or" for clarity**: Explicit logical operators, very LLM-friendly
* **Extensible**: Easy to add complex constraint logic and union types
* **Familiar**: Similar to Haskell's `=>` and Rust's `where` clauses

#### **Implementation Plan**

1. **Parser**: Add constraint annotation parsing to type expressions
2. **AST**: Extend type nodes to include explicit constraint annotations
3. **Type System**: Integrate with existing constraint propagation system
4. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages for constraint violations
5. **REPL Support**: Show constraints in type inference output

---

#### **Optional + Result Types**

* `Option a` represents optional values (planned)
* `Result a e` represents success (`Ok a`) or failure (`Err e`) (planned)
* `unit` is used to represent absence or unit values

---

### ⚡ Effect System

Noolang makes **side effects explicit** in types. All functions that perform I/O, mutation, or other impure operations must declare those effects.

#### **🎯 Effect System Refactoring Plan**

**Current Problem**: Effects are embedded within function types, creating architectural limitations.

**Target Architecture**: Expressions should have **`(Type, Effects)` pairs** instead of types with embedded effects.

```typescript
// Current: Effects embedded in types  
type TypeWithEffects = FunctionType & { effects: Effect[] }

// Target: Separate type and effects
type ExpressionResult = {
  type: Type,
  effects: Effects  
}
```

#### **Effect Type Syntax**

* Effects follow the return type using postfix annotation: `: Type !effect1 !effect2`
* **Design Philosophy**: Using effects should be "a little annoying" to encourage pure code
* **Explicit Only**: No effect inference - all effects must be declared manually

```noolang
# Pure expressions - no effects
add = fn x y => x + y : (Float) -> (Float) -> Float

# Effectful expressions - explicit effect annotations  
readFile = fn path => ... : String !read
logLine = fn msg => log msg : Unit !log
getUserInput = fn prompt => ... : String !read !log
```

#### **Effect Composition Rules**

* **Union Composition**: `!write !read + !log !read = !write !read !log`
* **Explicit Effects**: Keep all effects visible rather than unifying to most permissive
* **Effect Propagation**: Effects must propagate through function composition

```noolang
# Effect composition examples
fileLogger = fn msg => (
  content = readFile "log.txt" : String !read;
  logLine (content + msg) : {} !log  
) : Unit !read !log  # Both effects required

# Function composition preserves effects
safeFileLog = compose fileLogger  # Still requires !read !log
```

#### **Implementation Plan**

**✅ Phase 1: Enable Parser (COMPLETE)**
1. ✅ Fixed `!effect` parsing syntax in parser
2. ✅ Updated AST types to include effect annotations  
3. ✅ Basic parsing working without breaking existing code
4. ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 10/10 tests passing
5. ✅ Refactored to use `Set<Effect>` for automatic deduplication
6. ✅ Proper error handling for invalid effects and syntax

**✅ Phase 2: Type System Integration (COMPLETE)**
7. ✅ Modified `TypeResult` in `src/typer/types.ts` to include effects
8. ✅ Updated `typeExpression` to return `(Type, Effects)` pairs
9. ✅ Implemented effect union composition logic

**✅ Phase 3: Effect Validation (COMPLETE)**  
10. ✅ Check that functions with effects are properly annotated
11. ✅ Propagate effects through function composition
12. ✅ Add effect mismatch error reporting

#### **Current Effect Implementation**

* **✅ Phase 1 Complete**: Effect parsing syntax fully implemented and working
* **✅ Phase 2 Complete**: Effects separated into (Type, Effects) pairs throughout type system
* **✅ Phase 3 Complete**: Effect validation and propagation through all language constructs
* **✅ Parser Support**: Functions can be typed with effects using `!effect` syntax
* **✅ Set-based Storage**: Effects stored as `Set<Effect>` for automatic deduplication
* **✅ Comprehensive Testing**: Phase 2 (31/31), Phase 3 (40/40) tests passing
* **✅ Built-in Functions**: Complete set of effectful functions (read/write, logging, random, state mutation)
* **✅ Effect Propagation**: Automatic effect collection through function composition and data structures

#### **Rules**

* Pure expressions need no effect annotations
* Effects are compositional and must propagate up through the call chain
* The type checker must enforce that callers of effectful functions also declare those effects
* A file is considered effectful if its top-level expression is effectful

#### **Planned Core Effects**

| Effect   | Purpose                                   | Why include it                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!log`   | Logging, tracing, debugging output        | Ubiquitous and benign, but useful to track              |
| `!read`  | External reads (file, network, env)       | Non-deterministic input                                 |
| `!write` | External writes (file, network, env)      | Side effects / state mutation                           |
| `!state` | Mutable internal state (refs, cells, etc) | Tracks impurity without implying I/O                    |
| `!time`  | Access to clocks or timers                | Invisible side effects and determinism risk             |
| `!rand`  | RNG or anything entropy-based             | Non-determinism / fuzzing risk                          |
| `!ffi`   | Calls to native or foreign functions      | Black-box behavior, may implicitly wrap other effects   |
| `!async` | Execution that may suspend or defer       | Time non-locality; may delay evaluation or resume later |

---

### 🚧 **PLANNED: Unknown Type and Dynamic Values**

Noolang will support an `Unknown` type for values whose types cannot be statically determined, primarily for FFI integration and gradual typing scenarios.

#### **Unknown Type Design**

* **Purpose**: Represent dynamically typed values from FFI calls or explicit dynamic behavior
* **Safety**: Type refinement through pattern matching ensures safe usage
* **Explicit Opt-in**: `forget` operation to convert any type to `Unknown`

#### **Type Refinement Pattern Matching**

Pattern matching on `Unknown` values refines them to concrete types:

```noolang
# FFI returns Unknown
result = ffi "node" "fs.readFileSync";

# Pattern matching refines the type
content = match result (
  String s => "got string: " + s;
  Error e => "got error";
  Function f => "got function";
  _ => "got something unexpected"
);
```

#### **forget Operation**

Explicit conversion from any type to `Unknown`:

```noolang
myFloat = 42;                    # myFloat: Float
dynamic = forget myFloat;        # dynamic: Unknown
refined = match dynamic (
  Float n => n * 2;
  _ => 0
);
```

#### **Design Principles**

* **Explicit Boundaries**: Clear distinction between statically and dynamically typed code
* **Type Safety**: Pattern matching ensures all cases are handled
* **Gradual Typing**: Smooth interop between typed and untyped worlds
* **FFI Integration**: Natural representation for foreign function results

---

### 🚧 **PLANNED: Trait/Typeclass System**

Noolang will implement a trait system for clean polymorphism and principled abstraction over types.

#### **Design Philosophy**

* **Foundational Feature**: Enables clean implementation of monadic operations, collections, and other abstractions
* **Principled Polymorphism**: No ad-hoc overloading - all polymorphism through explicit traits
* **Monadic Integration**: Natural support for `Option`, `Result`, `IO`, and other monadic types

#### **Trait Syntax (Proposed)**

```noolang
# Trait definition
trait Monad m where
  bind : m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  pure : a -> m a

# Trait instances  
instance Monad Option where
  bind = option_bind
  pure = Some

instance Monad (Result e) where
  bind = result_bind
  pure = Ok
```

#### **Monadic Operators**

The `|?` operator will be introduced as "optional chaining" but implemented as proper monadic bind:

```noolang
# Introduced as optional chaining
user |? getProfile |? getSettings |? formatData

# Actually implemented as monadic bind
# user >>= getProfile >>= getSettings >>= formatData
```

#### **Benefits**

* **Clean Abstractions**: Unified interface for different monadic types
* **Extensibility**: User-defined traits and instances
* **Type Safety**: Compiler-enforced trait bounds
* **Familiar Patterns**: Based on proven Haskell/Rust designs

#### **Implementation Requirements**

1. **Trait Definitions**: Syntax for defining traits with associated types/functions
2. **Instance Declarations**: Syntax for implementing traits for specific types
3. **Trait Bounds**: Constrained polymorphic functions with trait requirements
4. **Resolution**: Automatic instance resolution during type checking
5. **Coherence**: Ensure unique instance resolution (no overlapping instances)

---

### 🚧 **PLANNED: FFI System Integration**

The Foreign Function Interface will integrate with the trait and Unknown type systems to provide safe, principled interop.

#### **FFI Type Flow**

```noolang
# FFI calls return Unknown by default
fs = ffi "node" "fs";               # fs: Unknown

# Optional accessors for safe property access  
readFile = fs |? @readFileSync?;    # readFile: Option Unknown

# Monadic chaining with |? operator
result = readFile |? fn f => f ["file.txt"] |? processContent;

# Type refinement through pattern matching
content = match result (
  Some (String s) => s;
  _ => "failed to read file"
);
```

#### **Platform Adapters**

FFI adapters interpret platform-specific paths and provide optional type information:

```noolang
# Node.js adapter knows about common APIs
readFileSync = ffi "node" "fs.readFileSync";  # Could return typed function
log = ffi "node" "console.log";               # Could return String -> Unit !log

# Unknown adapters default to Unknown
custom = ffi "myplatform" "some.api";         # Returns Unknown
```

#### **Design Benefits**

* **Platform Agnostic**: Adapters handle platform-specific details
* **Type Safety**: Unknown type with refinement prevents runtime errors
* **Extensibility**: Easy to add new platform adapters
* **Principled**: Builds on solid trait and type system foundations

---

### 🔧 Type Inference Strategy (Current Implementation)

* **✅ Functional Hindley-Milner**: Fully implemented with let-polymorphism
* **✅ Constraint Propagation**: Robust constraint system with proper unification
* **✅ Type Variable Management**: Fresh variable generation and substitution
* **✅ Type Variable Unification**: Type variables properly resolve to concrete types (e.g., shows `(Float) -> Float` not `t1 -> t2`)
* Effects must always be declared manually and are not inferred (by design)
* REPL and dev tools can show inferred types inline for LLM and human inspection

---

### 🧪 Current Implementation Status

* **Parser**: ✅ Fully supports type annotations with `name = expr : type` syntax
* **Expression-level type annotations**: ✅ `(expr : type)` syntax fully implemented and working
* **Type Variables**: ✅ Proper unification to concrete types (shows `(Float) -> Float` not `t1 -> t2`)
* **Effect Annotations**: ✅ Parser fully supports `!effect` syntax (Phase 1 complete)
* **Record Type Annotations**: ❌ Parser doesn't support `{ name: String, age: Float }` yet
* **Type Constructors**: ❌ `List T`, `Tuple T1 T2` not implemented yet
* **Constraint Annotations**: ❌ `given` syntax not implemented yet (constraints work automatically)

### 🎯 Next Implementation Priorities

1. **Trait/Typeclass System**: Foundational feature for clean polymorphism and monadic operations
   - Trait definition syntax (`trait Name where ...`)
   - Instance declaration syntax (`instance Trait Type where ...`)
   - Trait resolution and instance lookup in type checker
   - Coherence checking to prevent overlapping instances

2. **Unknown Type and Type Refinement**: Support for dynamically typed values
   - `Unknown` type for FFI integration and gradual typing
   - Pattern matching for type refinement of Unknown values
   - `forget` operation to convert any type to Unknown

3. **Monadic Operators**: `|?` operator for clean optional chaining
   - Implement as monadic bind using trait system
   - Support for Option, Result, and other monadic types
   - Introduce as "optional chaining" for approachability

4. **Optional Accessors**: `@field?` syntax for safe field access
   - Return Option types for missing fields
   - Chain naturally with `|?` operator
   - Work uniformly on records and Unknown values

5. **FFI System**: Foreign function interface (after foundational features)
   - Platform adapter architecture
   - Integration with Unknown type system
   - Effect tracking for foreign function calls

---

### 🎯 Planned: Destructuring Patterns

Noolang will support **destructuring patterns** for tuples and records to enable more ergonomic data extraction and import spreading.

#### **Design Philosophy**

* **Safety First**: Only support destructuring for data structures with fixed, statically-known structure
* **Explicit Patterns**: Clear, predictable syntax that's LLM-friendly
* **No List Destructuring**: Lists have variable length, making destructuring unsafe
* **Immutable Variables**: Destructuring creates new immutable bindings

#### **Tuple Destructuring**

Extract values from tuples by position:

```noolang
# Basic tuple destructuring
{one, two} = {1, True}  # one = 1, two = True

# With type annotations
{first: Float, second: String} = {42, "hello"}  # first = 42, second = "hello"

# Nested destructuring (future)
{outer: {inner, rest}} = {outer: {1, 2}, rest: 3}
```

**Grammar**: `{identifier, identifier, ...} = tuple_expression`

#### **Record Destructuring**

Extract fields from records with flexible naming:

```noolang
# Record destructuring with renaming
{@key localName} = {@key True}  # localName = True

# Record shorthand (field name = variable name)
{@key, @key2} = {@key True, @key2 2}  # key = True, key2 = 2

# Mixed renaming and shorthand
{@name userName, @age} = {@name "Alice", @age 30}  # userName = "Alice", age = 30
```

**Grammar**: 
* `{@identifier identifier} = record_expression` (rename)
* `{@identifier} = record_expression` (shorthand)

#### **Import Spreading**

Use destructuring to extract functions from imported modules:

```noolang
# Import and destructure math functions
{add, multiply} = import "std/math"
result = add 2 3

# Import with renaming
{@add addFn, @multiply mulFn} = import "std/math"
result = addFn 2 3

# Import with shorthand
{@add, @multiply} = import "std/math"
result = add 2 3
```

#### **Safety Guarantees**

* **No Name Collisions**: Attempting to destructure into an existing variable name is an error
* **Complete Patterns**: All fields in a record must be accounted for (no partial destructuring)
* **Type Safety**: Each destructured field gets proper type inference
* **Static Analysis**: All destructuring patterns are validated at parse time

#### **Implementation Requirements**

1. **Parser**: Add destructuring patterns to definition expressions
2. **AST**: `TupleDestructuringExpression`, `RecordDestructuringExpression` node types
3. **Evaluator**: Extract and bind multiple values from destructured data
4. **Type System**: Handle type inference for each destructured field
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for incomplete or invalid patterns

#### **Why No List Destructuring**

List destructuring is intentionally excluded because:

* **Variable Length**: Lists can have any length, making patterns unpredictable
* **Runtime Errors**: Would require complex error handling for length mismatches
* **Type Safety**: Hard to statically guarantee pattern safety
* **Alternative**: Use `head`/`tail` functions or future pattern matching

#### **Future Extensions**

* **Nested Destructuring**: Support destructuring within destructuring patterns
* **Default Values**: Allow default values for optional record fields
* **Pattern Matching**: Integrate with future `match`/`case` expressions
* **Type Annotations**: Support type annotations within destructuring patterns

## ✅ Import System (Fully Implemented)

### Complete Import System with Static Type Inference

Noolang features a **fully implemented import system** with complete static type inference, destructuring support, and seamless integration with the type system.

#### Current Implementation Status

- ✅ **Static Type Inference**: Imports are fully typed with complete type information
- ✅ **Destructuring Support**: Full destructuring patterns with renaming
- ✅ **Path Resolution**: Relative and absolute path support
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ **Integration**: Works seamlessly with all language features

#### Import Syntax (Implemented)

**Basic Import:**
```noolang
# Import entire module with full type inference
math = import "math_module"  # math : { @add Float -> Float -> Float, @multiply Float -> Float -> Float }
result = (@add math) 2 3     # result : Float
```

**Destructuring Import (Recommended):**
```noolang
# Direct destructuring with full static typing
{@add, @multiply} = import "math_module"
# add : Float -> Float -> Float
# multiply : Float -> Float -> Float

result = add 2 3 + multiply 4 5  # => 25 : Float
```

**Destructuring with Renaming:**
```noolang
{@add addFunc, @multiply mulFunc} = import "math_module"
result = addFunc 2 3  # => 5 : Float
```

#### Type Inference Capabilities

The import system provides **complete static type inference** for all module types:

```noolang
# Primitive type imports
number = import "number_module"     # number : Float
text = import "string_module"       # text : String
items = import "list_module"        # items : List Float

# Function imports  
doubler = import "function_module"  # doubler : Float -> Float

# Complex record imports
utils = import "utility_module"     # utils : { @format String -> String, @parse String -> Option Float }
```

#### Design Principles (Achieved)
- ✅ **Lexical Scoping**: Imports apply to current expression scope
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Complete static type checking and inference
- ✅ **Tooling Support**: Full type information for IDE integration  
- ✅ **Consistent Syntax**: Natural integration with Noolang patterns
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of import failures

#### 🚧 Future Feature: Constraint Import Integration

The import system currently handles value-level imports. **Future enhancement** will integrate with user-defined constraints and typeclass instances.

**Design Questions for Future Implementation**:
- How should user-defined constraints be imported and activated?
- Should constraint imports use special syntax or integrate with existing destructuring?
- How do constraint instances propagate through module boundaries?

**Current Status**: The trait system works with built-in constraints. User-defined constraint imports will be added in a future release.

### Typeclass Architecture Vision

#### Learning from Other Languages
- **Haskell**: Automatic instance resolution, coherence guarantees
- **Rust**: Explicit trait bounds, orphan rules
- **Swift**: Protocol conformance, extensions
- **Scala**: Implicit parameters, type class encoding

#### Open Design Questions

1. **User-Defined Constraints**: How do users define their own typeclasses?
   ```noolang
   # Possible syntax?
   constraint Numeric a where
     add : a -> a -> a
     multiply : a -> a -> a
   ```

2. **Instance Definition**: How are constraint implementations provided?
   ```noolang
   # Possible syntax?
   instance Numeric Float where
     add = intAdd
     multiply = intMultiply
   ```

3. **Import Integration**: How do constraints and instances flow through modules?
   ```noolang
   # How would this work?
   import "numeric.noo" {Numeric}
   use Numeric  # Activate for type checking?
   ```

4. **Resolution Strategy**: Automatic instance resolution vs explicit passing?

#### Current Constraint System Status
- ✅ **hasField constraints**: Working well for record field access
- ✅ **Constraint propagation**: Automatic through function composition  
- ❌ **User-defined constraints**: Not yet supported
- ❌ **Constraint import/export**: Architecture unclear
- 🧹 **Cleanup complete**: Removed meaningless built-in constraints

#### Next Steps for Typeclass System
1. **Design constraint definition syntax**
2. **Plan instance resolution mechanism** 
3. **Integrate with import system design**
4. **Consider effect system interactions**
5. **Prototype user-defined constraint support**

### 🎯 Planned: VSCode Type Integration

Enable rich editor support through Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration.

#### **Core Features**

* **Hover Type Information**: Show inferred types when hovering over expressions
* **Intellisense/Autocomplete**: Variable names, function signatures, record field suggestions
* **Error Squiggles**: Real-time type error highlighting
* **Go-to-Definition**: Navigate to variable/function definitions

#### **Implementation Strategy**

The existing type system infrastructure provides everything needed:

* **Type Inference**: Hindley-Milner system already computes all type information
* **AST Mapping**: Parser tracks source positions for mapping cursor to AST nodes
* **VSCode Extension**: Foundation already exists with syntax highlighting

#### **LSP Server Architecture**

```typescript
// Core LSP operations using existing type system
onHover(position) => {
  const node = findASTNodeAtPosition(position)
  const typeResult = typeExpression(node, currentState)
  return formatTypeForDisplay(typeResult.type)
}

onCompletion(position) => {
  const context = getCompletionContext(position)
  return getAvailableCompletions(context.environment)
}
```
