# Test that local variables from extract don't persist globally

# First, try to use a math function before extract (should fail)
# This will be commented out since it would cause an error
# result1 = max 1 2;  # This would fail - max not defined yet

# Extract math functions locally
extract import "std/math";

# Use local functions
result2 = max 10 20;  # Should work - local from extract

# The local environment should be cleared after this evaluation
# So in a new evaluation context, max should not be available

result2
