# Test that extract properly validates record types

# This should work - extract from a record
extract { @a 1; @b 2 };

# This should work - extract from an import (which returns a record)
extract import "std/math";

# These should fail:
# extract [1; 2; 3];  # List - not a record
# extract { 1; 2 };   # Tuple - not a record  
# extract 42;         # Number - not a record

# Use the extracted variables
result1 = a;  # Should be 1
result2 = b;  # Should be 2
result3 = max 10 20;  # Should be 20

{ @result1 result1;
  @result2 result2;
  @result3 result3 }
