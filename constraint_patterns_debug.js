console.log("=== CONSTRAINT PATTERN ANALYSIS ===\n");

// Example 1: Simple accessor - should be multiplicative
console.log("1. SIMPLE ACCESSOR: @street person");
console.log("   Expression typing creates:");
console.log("   - Function: α -> β given α has {street: β}");
console.log("   - Application: person type unified with α");
console.log("   - Result: β (the street value)");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Constraint collection should create:");
console.log("   - MULTIPLICATIVE: person_var has {street: result_var}");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Why multiplicative? Single direct field access.\n");

// Example 2: Composed accessor - what should it be?
console.log("2. COMPOSED ACCESSOR: @street (@address person)");
console.log("   Expression typing creates:");
console.log("   - Inner: @address typed as α₁ -> β₁ given α₁ has {address: β₁}");
console.log("   - Outer: @street typed as α₂ -> β₂ given α₂ has {street: β₂}");
console.log("   - Chain: person → address_record → street_value");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Current constraint collection creates:");
console.log("   - ADDITIVE: person_var has {address: intermediate_var}");
console.log("   -           intermediate_var has {street: final_var}");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Alternative multiplicative form:");
console.log("   - MULTIPLICATIVE: person_var has {address: {street: final_var}}");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Question: Which is correct for composition?\n");

// Example 3: Multiple independent accessors - should be additive
console.log("3. MULTIPLE ACCESSORS: fn p => (@name p, @age p)");
console.log("   Expression typing creates:");
console.log("   - @name: α₁ -> β₁ given α₁ has {name: β₁}");
console.log("   - @age:  α₂ -> β₂ given α₂ has {age: β₂}");
console.log("   - Both applied to same parameter p");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Constraint collection should create:");
console.log("   - ADDITIVE: p_var has {name: name_var}");
console.log("   -           p_var has {age: age_var}");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Why additive? Independent field accesses, not composition.\n");

// Example 4: Conditional accessor - multiplicative but context-dependent
console.log("4. CONDITIONAL ACCESS: fn p => if condition then @street (@address p) else @city p");
console.log("   Expression typing creates:");
console.log("   - Two different constraint chains depending on branch");
console.log("   - Union type for result");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Constraint collection options:");
console.log("   - MULTIPLICATIVE (per branch): p has {address: {street: α}} | p has {city: β}");
console.log("   - ADDITIVE (unified): p has {address: α}, α has {street: γ}, p has {city: β}");
console.log("   ");
console.log("   Which enables better type checking?\n");

// Analysis
console.log("=== ANALYSIS ===");
console.log("Multiplicative (nested) constraints:");
console.log("  - Represent single logical paths through data");
console.log("  - Good for: direct access, function composition, declarative types");
console.log("  - Example: {address: {street: String}} describes structure");
console.log("");
console.log("Additive (separate) constraints:");
console.log("  - Represent multiple independent requirements");
console.log("  - Good for: multiple accesses, constraint accumulation, inference");
console.log("  - Example: [has address, has name] describes capabilities");
console.log("");
console.log("Current problem:");
console.log("  - Constraint collection uses additive (fresh variables)");
console.log("  - Expression typing expects multiplicative (unified variables)");
console.log("  - Variables don't align, resolution fails");
console.log("");
console.log("Possible solutions:");
console.log("  1. Convert additive → multiplicative during resolution");
console.log("  2. Use multiplicative throughout for compositions");
console.log("  3. Unify variables between systems");
console.log("  4. Different operators for different patterns");
